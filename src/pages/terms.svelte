<h2 id="acceptable-use">Acceptable Use</h2>
<p><b>Short version:</b> WeCarry provides a service to help individuals serve one another through hand-carry or similar services. Absolutely by no means should WeCarry be used for any illegal or immoral activities. We trust and expect our users to be respectful, law-abiding individuals with a heart of service towards one another who interact with each other with grace. WeCarry cannot be aware of all local laws regarding import and export of items and we leave it to Requesters and Providers to be aware of and in compliance with applicable regulations. </p>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations. </p>

<h2 id="user-generated-content">User-Generated Content</h2>
<p><b>Short version:</b>  You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need in order to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</p>
<p>
  <b>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</b><br />
  You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
</p>
<p>
  <b>2. WeCarry May Remove Content</b><br />
  We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any WeCarry terms or policies.
</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities-of-requesters">Responsibilities of Requesters</h2>
<p>Requesters are responsible to clearly and accurately communicate all relevant details regarding their requests to potential providers. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reasonably accurate estimation of size and weight of item</li>
  <li>Agreement of reimbursement for any extra fees incurred during transit</li>
  <li>Contact information to keep in touch during transit and for delivery of items</li>
  <li>Confirmation of date, time, and location for delivery</li>
  <li>An idea of what to expect during the customs and imigration process with regards to bag search, interview, and potential taxes or charges for bringing items into country</li>
  <li>Any paperwork needed for customs and immigration</li>
  <li>If a request is a package containing multiple items, a full inventory should be provided</li>
  <li>No durian. Seriously, we know it is amazing, but don't request it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requesters should be familiar with any applicable law regulating the acquisition and import of items and should not break any laws in the use of WeCarry.</p>
<p>Requesters cannot hold us or Providers liable for lost, stolen, or damaged goods in transit. As such, Requesters should be careful in their selection and acceptance of offers for carry services to only work with trusted individuals. Any necessary financial arrangements for reimbursement and incidentals should be discussed and agreed upon between the Requester and Provider prior to accepting offers for service.</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities-of-providers">Responsibilities of Providers</h2>
<p>Providers are responsible to ensure they have all the information they need to acquire, transport, and deliver the items requested. Providers must take great care in transporting items for others and make a best effort to keep items safe from loss, theft, or damage. Any necessary financial arrangements for reimbursement and incidentals should be discussed and agreed upon between the Requester and Provider prior to committing to provide the service. If any additional costs are incurred to transport requested items, the Provider should collect receipts to give the Requester. Providers should keep the requester informed regarding travel changes or delays that may impact the agreed upon time and place for delivery.</p>

<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
<p>Organizations are responsible for payment for the use of WeCarry. We are responsible for billing organizations accurately.</p>

<h2 id="cancellation-and-termination">Cancellation and Termination</h2>
<p>You may cancel this agreement by closing your Account at any time.</p>
<p>Organizations that have made payment and wish to cancel service can do so with written notice. If cancelled within the first half of the billing cycle 50% of the service fee will be refunded. After 50% of the billing cycle no refunds will be given. For example on an annual plan with a billing cycle starting January 1st, if service is canceled before June 30th, half of the annual fee will be returned, whereas cancellations after July 1st will not receive any refunds.</p>
